Dear Human Resource Recruiter,

I am Selina Tuladhar and I have just completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering recently this year.I, from a 
very small age have been interested in Computer Science and IT related topics. That is what made me decide to
complete my undergrads in Computer Engineering.

I think I am a perfect fit for this internship because firstly, I match all the skills and qualifications that
are required for me to get this internship. A plus for me would definitely be that I love challenges and I
absolutely enjoy working in a very versatile environment. Well, seeing your application procedure has made me
definitely realize that Hedgeye is a very creative company because this is the first time I am filling out an 
application this way. I would like to think of myself as a very peoples' person who likes to keep herself updated 
with everything that is new.

Yes, I do realize this has turned out to become more like a cover letter but I think what makes me stand out 
is the fact that I have studied in Nepal and I've just moved to the States. Well,  I've been here before but more
as a tourist but since I have completed my undergrads I have decided to live here more permanently(definitely not
illegally since I have a legal permanent resident card) because I believe America is a land of opportunities and I
would definitely love to expand my knowledge on Computer Science and this internship is all the things I want at 
this stage of my career.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Selina Tuladhar
